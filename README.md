# ❗Service Learning Project

❗❗❗All items beginning with a red exclamation mark (such as this note) 
are included in the README to indicate you need to change this section. 
Once the section is complete, remove the exclamation mark. 
This includes the title above, which should be changed to 
something more appropriate for your project.❗❗❗

## Basic Information

**Course**: CSC 330 - Database Systems

**Term**: Spring 2020

**Instructors**: Dr. Jasmine Jones and Dr. Scott Heggen

❗️**Author(s)**: Your name(s) here, including your role(s) in the team.

❗️**Project Title**: What will your final product be called?

❗**Purpose**: In a single sentence, describe what your software system will do.

❗️**Community Partner**: Include the name(s) of the partners. Do *not* include
their contact information here, as this will be a public repository. 
 
❗**References**: 
Throughout this project, you'll likely use multiple outside resources.
Reference all ideas which are not your own, and describe and
how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes
online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that
are not solely your own contribution. Update this section as your project progresses!

## ❗Documentation

Throughout the project, you will be generating documentation about your software. 
To name a few:
- Paper Prototypes
- Software Specifications
- E-R Diagrams
- User Stories

Include a link to each of these artifacts in this section as they are created. 

## ❗Installation Instructions

Provide the next developer of this repository with instructions on how to
deploy the software for themselves. If your installation has limitations (e.g., 
only tested on a Windows 10 machine) or dependencies (e.g., this software 
must run on Linux due to a specific library), indicate them at the beginning 
of this section.  

The instructors will follow the instructions you provide in this section verbatim. 
Make sure your instructions are tested by multiple people, including those not
in your group and possibly not in the class. If we cannot install your software, 
we can't grade your final product! 

### ❗User Instructions 
Assume the reader of this section has never seen your software before.
If there are multiple user (e.g., admin, customer, etc), be sure to write
instructions for each (a couple subsections?), where appropriate. 

### ❗Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. 
Use this section to create a bullet list of all known errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. 
Bugs you acknowledge here won't be penalized.
Bugs found that aren't acknowledged here will be penalized!
